This directory contains the C implementation of FF-v2.3, as it was
used in the 3rd international planning competition. Build the planner
by typing

make

Which produces an executable named

ff

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,

made edits to print states. different from postICAPS version by commenting out some code at the end of output.c. Uncomment to get the postICAPS branch version.
