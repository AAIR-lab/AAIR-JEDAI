True,4416,False,"Very well","Daily","4-6 times a week","Very curious","Very inclined","Moderately helpful","Moderately challenging","Moderately Intuitive","Very curious","Very well","N/A","N/A","I really appreciate the hard work that has been putforth in bringing this simulation up. 
* One of the major conerns or a user-frustration I faced was probably hovering the simulator. The controls were kinda off while trying to control and watch how the simulation works.
* I loved how simple the sections were provided with multiple drop-boxes to choose from while providing the rules.
* However, it is not practically possible to make the simulation run half-way, where the user tests whether the instructions given is right or wrong, but maybe I would give this a feedback in case if you are able to provide it. 
* I would appreciate if you could enhance the error texts being more easy to understand, it was pretty neat to understand, but takes a bit more cognitive load to completely understand what the error actually is. I liked the error detection of highlighting the red color wherever necessary.
* The simulation UI page could be still monitored into a dark theme, as I have observed a lot of simulation software working upon dark themes, this will help the user focus upon the simulation by reducing lot of light entering into their eyes, as it takes lot of time to train the model.
* One of the points of curiosity was to know how the robot actually works in the end, that drives me to finish the task, even if it was bit challenging.
